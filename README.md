## Basic Concept
This project aims to classify brain tumor images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image classification tasks. By training a CNN on a dataset of brain tumor images, we can create a model capable of accurately predicting the presence and type of brain tumors in new MRI scans.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from [source]. It consists of [number] MRI images of the brain, divided into the following categories:
- Category 1: [description]
- Category 2: [description]
- Category 3: [description]
