# Brain Tumor Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims to classify brain tumor images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of MRI images of the brain, labeled with different types of tumors.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [source]. It consists of [number] MRI images of the brain, divided into the following categories:
- Category 1: [description]
- Category 2: [description]
- Category 3: [description]
