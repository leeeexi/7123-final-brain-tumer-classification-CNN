## Basic Concept
This project aims to classify brain tumor images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image classification tasks. By training a CNN on a dataset of brain tumor images, we can create a model capable of accurately predicting the presence and type of brain tumors in the MRI scans.
##Why doing this project?
- Brain tumor images often contain subtle and complex features that may be difficult for human observers to detect. Tumors can vary in size, shape, texture, and location, making them challenging to identify accurately.
- Brain tumor imaging can involve various modalities such as MRI, CT, and PET scans, each with its own strengths and limitations. Integrating information from multiple modalities to accurately diagnose and classify tumors adds to the complexity.
- Detecting brain tumors at an early stage and accurately localizing them within the brain are critical for successful treatment. However, early-stage tumors may be small and subtle, making them challenging to detect using traditional methods.
- Timely diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors are crucial for patient outcomes. However, the complexity and variability of brain tumor images can delay diagnosis, leading to potential delays in treatment and poorer outcomes for patients.
In doing this project, I hope to explore the usage of deep learning on medical diagnosis.
